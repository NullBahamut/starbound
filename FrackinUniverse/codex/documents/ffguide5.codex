   "FrackinUniverse adds a great number of additional status effects. This short guide should help to sort them out for you. Click next page to continue.",
   "Tile Effects:  Some tiles give buffs or debuffs when stepped on. Many of these will not give indicators, but will affect your movement. Snow, mud, jungle dirt and clay are some examples of this in action. Asphalt increases your ground speed, which is useful in bases. Experiment, and you might find some really useful stuff.",
   "Temperature: Cold, Heat and Radiation are things from ordinary Starbound. Frackin' Universe adds its own tiers of these in the form of ^orange;Deadly Cold, Deadly Heat and Deadly Radiation^reset;. To survive these hazards you'll need special gear (this gear usually displays the immunity) such as Mutavisk Armor for Deadly Radiation. ",
   "Proto Poison: This nasty effect is a threat on Proto Worlds. It will slowly sap your maximum health and *will* eventually kill you. Seek out proto-poison protection from various gear in your lab stations. Augments are always an option.",
   "Acid: You don't want to take a dip in sulphuric acid. It's not good for your long-term survival goals. Instead, protect yourself with a layer of Acid Protection. Many suits of armor provide this, as well as augments you can craft in your nanofabricator.",
   "Insanity: A constant degradation of your mental state, insanity saps your ability to protect yourself over a sustained period by draining your Protection. Additionally, it gives a mild bit of damage per tick. Augments and armor exist to combat this nasty effect. You'll find this effect on Atropus biomes.",
   "Pressure: Perhaps the deadliest of all the status effects, extreme pressure will ^red;definitely kill you in seconds^reset; if you do not have protection. Thankfully, it is found in few places (primarily on Gas Ball biomes). Do not risk this environment effect without a protective suit. You *will* die.",
   "Poison: Fairly self explanatory. You don't want to be poisoned, but some are worse than others. You've got basic poison, mercury poison (which is especially nasty), and darkwater poison to name a few. Poison protection will block all poison types, not just one.",
   "Pus: This fluid is absolutely repulsive, and even having the stuff on you causes retching and nausea. To traverse it, you will need some sort of protection. Thankfully, it is rarely lethal.",
   "Black Tar: Black tar slows you down ^red;a lot^reset; and makes jumping a decent height nearly impossible. It hampers, but does not directly cause damage. You can block it with various armors or produce.",
   "Organic Soup: One of the few effects that is actually something you *want*. Organic soup will increase your health total as well as remove the effects of hunger (and even fill you up!). Take a bath in it when you can!",
   "Bio Ooze: This fluid will stick to you, make you ill and affect your movement and survival chances while active. Wearing protection is recommended. Most common on Proto Worlds and a few other select biomes.",
   "Note that there are many other effects you can be affected by in your exploration of the universe. Not all of them can be resisted, and some might be resisted by surprising things. Just stay aware...and stay safe."
